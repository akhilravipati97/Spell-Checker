The "cpp" file links a text file "all_words_no_meaning.txt" to create the trie data structure, so make sure both the "cpp" and "all_words_no_meaning.txt" files are in the same directory.

It will be asking a word to check and will tell if it is spelled correctly or not. It will NOT suggest the correct word for the wrongly spelled words. It can be changed as per will, to make it more flexible etc, in whatever way you choose.
